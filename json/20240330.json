Despite being larger than many other tree-dwelling mammals, three-toed sloths have adapted by reducing their muscle mass and size to thrive on treetops. Their large stomachs have four chambers, which, when full, account for about 30% of their body weight. These shaggy critters are so sedentary that algae grow on their coats, which helps to camouflage them within the rainforest canopy. In 2021, these slow-moving creatures were declared national symbols in Costa Rica. Then-president Carlos Alvarado signed the initiative into law to emphasize the sloths' importance in the country's ecosystem.","date":"Mar 30, 2024","bsTitle":"Hello from the upside-down!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240330_SleepySloth%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e20aca84bc38ae58972719cb583877b5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
