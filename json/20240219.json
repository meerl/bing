Initially established to honor George Washington's birthday, Presidents Day has evolved into a celebration of all presidents. Revered among them is Abraham Lincoln, a towering figure in American history, who guided the country through the Civil War and abolished slavery in America. The Lincoln Memorial, seen in today's image, overlooks the Reflecting Pool at the west end of the National Mall in Washington, DC. Designed in a neoclassical style, the memorial is a poignant destination for those seeking to connect with American history during Presidents Day, and beyond.","date":"Feb 19, 2024","bsTitle":"A tribute at twilight","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240219_LincolnSunset%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2aed74202801fc18827c25a80e43b490","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
