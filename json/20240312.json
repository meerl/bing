The park's hiking trails guide you among the world's largest collection of hoodoos, which are rock spires formed by erosion. The horseshoe-shaped natural amphitheaters create a surreal landscape that changes with the play of sunlight. The area was initially inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Paiute people. Although there is no evidence of them having lived there permanently, Paiute Indians used the Paunsaugunt Plateau for seasonal hunting and gathering. Designated a national park in 1928, Bryce Canyon is dotted with several viewpoints like Inspiration Point, Yovimpa Point, and Rainbow Point, which offer panoramic vistas of the surrounding topography.","date":"Mar 12, 2024","bsTitle":"Guardians of the canyon","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240312_BryceSnow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9426325b3bc4a5a3ddfc141036096afd","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
