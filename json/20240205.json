Traveling south to escape the winter weather, they use air currents to help them make journeys of hundreds of miles. They descend to gather in large numbers on eucalyptus trees, like the ones pictured on our homepage today in Goleta, Santa Barbara County. Those gathered to see clusters of butterflies in 100-foot-tall trees might confuse them for clumps of leaves at first. However, as the sun's rays gently fall upon them, their wings will begin to flutter. Bring your binoculars and take the opportunity to witness these winged wonders huddled together. It's truly a sight to behold!","date":"Feb 5, 2024","bsTitle":"Butterfly ballet","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240205_WesternMonarchs%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3d7b7f5f4fbccf861c621d00bc56f968","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
