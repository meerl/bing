This festival of colors, spring, and love is a cornerstone of Indian and Nepali culture. It is also celebrated in other countries with large Hindu populations, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, the US, the UK, Suriname, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Festivities last for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the last full moon in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which usually falls in March in the Gregorian calendar. As the sun sets, people gather to light bonfires, a ritual known as Holika Dahan, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The following day, the streets come alive with people splashing each other in colors, giving everyone a vibrant makeover.
