Peeking out of those misty waters is Bonsai Rock, the unlikely home of four small trees that have taken root in its cracks. Its name was inspired by the Japanese art of growing miniature trees, which are kept in small containers and pruned to control their size. The trees on Bonsai Rock are naturally restricted by the lack of space and nutrients, so no pruning is required. Part of the purpose of bonsai is to provide an opportunity for contemplation, and this tranquil spot high in the Sierra Nevada is the perfect place to relax and explore your thoughts. It is also popular with photographers, especially at sunset.","date":"Feb 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Taking root on Bonsai Rock","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240206_LakeTahoeRock%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"76c3103a6ac46452d01c9b4418770169","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
