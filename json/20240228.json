The fortress, once a strategic Anglo-Saxon stronghold, evolved over centuries into the imposing structure seen today. The site was the seat of the ancient Northumbrian kingdom—an early medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom covering present-day northern England and southeast Scotland. The original castle was destroyed by invading Vikings in 993 and a new castle was built here by the Normans. Today's castle is the result of various restorations in the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries. After surviving its share of attacks, Bamburgh Castle has made its way to the limelight due to its impressive silhouette against the North Sea, featuring in productions like 'Macbeth,' 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,' and 'Ivanhoe.'","date":"Feb 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Grow with the flow","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240228_BamburghCastleUK%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a842dfbdcad3835f1a39a368dd2a7605","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
