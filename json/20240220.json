At around 2,087 feet, Kinder Scout is the park's highest point and its rugged moorlands and windswept plateaus have drawn walkers and nature enthusiasts for generations. In 1932, it was the stage for a 'mass trespass,' in which hundreds of people on foot protested for public access to these lands. At the time, many areas of open countryside were closed to the British public. This act of civil disobedience prompted much public sympathy, which eventually led to the establishment of the UK's first national parks. The Peak District National Park was the first, designated in April 1951, ensuring that these hills and valleys would be preserved for future generations to enjoy.","date":"Feb 20, 2024","bsTitle":"A park for the people","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240220_PeakDistrictNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"feed7a5c2b017d32f22248b9b80ff391","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
