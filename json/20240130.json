This part of the Castile-La Mancha region is sometimes called Manchegan Switzerland, thanks to those snow-capped peaks during the winter months. The steep, rocky terrain here means the villagers, of whom there are less than 1,000, cultivate the land on terraces dug into the mountainside. To see Aýna from this perspective, you'll need to visit the Mirador del Diablo, or Devil's Viewpoint, one of several viewing areas dotted around this picturesque valley.","date":"Jan 30, 2024","bsTitle":"Spain's little Switzerland","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240130_AlbaceteSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"30069278dd13aeb961c2de1b1d565c25","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
