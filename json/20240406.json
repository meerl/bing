Today's date, April 6, makes up the Japanese word for castle, 'shiro' from 'shi' (4) and 'ro' (6). Hence, the celebration of castles. What better opportunity than Castle Day, to learn about the country's largest and most-visited castle, Himeji Castle? Dating back to 1333, this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts an advanced defensive design and five National Treasure structures. The castle has also withstood time and nature's fury, surviving the bombings of World War II and the Great Hanshin earthquake in 1995. Nearly 700 years of glory, local legends, and ghost stories reverberate through the 83 rooms of this hilltop fortress.
