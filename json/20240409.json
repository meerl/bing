That's exactly what awaits you at the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival in Washington. Founded in 1984 by the Mount Vernon Chamber of Commerce, it began as a three-day event but has since grown into a month-long fiesta. The festival runs from April to May and draws visitors from all over the world. The floral show spans multiple gardens in the valley, so make sure you explore Tulip Town, Tulip Valley Farms, Garden Rosalyn, and the 50-acre display at RoozenGaarde. You can tour the tulip gardens by bicycle and explore the local wineries, breweries, and restaurants. Among the petals, life slows down just enough for us to remember the simple joys—breathe deeply, smile widely, and revel in the spectacle that is the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival.","date":"Apr 9, 2024","bsTitle":"Tiptoe through the tulips","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240409_SkagitValleyTulips%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1766bf665a45429081098cf77071da1a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
