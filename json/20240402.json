The young leaves of these budding trees are significant to the Danish people, as they are harvested from April to May and used in cooking—particularly in salads. In the past, Europeans would often use the smooth bark of beech trees for writings texts and the word 'book' is thought to be derived from the word for 'beech.' As the sun shines through the forest canopy, wild anemones brighten up the woodland with their white petals. These blooms, representing delicate beauty and sincerity, have even starred in masterpieces by artists such as Monet and Vincent van Gogh.","date":"Apr 2, 2024","bsTitle":"Beneath a ray of light","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240402_JutlandSpring%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a66ca6218330234706497dee0a15ca5e","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
