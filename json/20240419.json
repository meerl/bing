Dating back to sometime between 2500 and 2000 BCE, this Neolithic henge—a type of ancient circular earthwork—and stone circle measure about 340 feet across. Lying on a narrow strip of land between two lochs, the site initially comprised 60 stones, although today only 36 remain. The exact purpose of the structure is still unknown, despite an excavation project at the site in 2008. In 1999, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney group of monuments, which includes the Ring of Brodgar, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. If you are planning a trip to Scotland, consider walking amid the echoes of history at the Ring of Brodgar while the crisp Scottish air embraces you.","date":"Apr 19, 2024","bsTitle":"History has come full circle","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240419_OrkneyStones%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"86fd927ab5bf67a9a33632e7a816b320","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
