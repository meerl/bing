California grows about 80% of the world's almonds and 100% of those produced commercially in the United States. Almonds have heart-healthy monounsaturated fats and are nutritional powerhouses, packed with fiber, protein, and an array of vitamins and minerals. During February and March, in California's Central Valley, these seeds—not nuts—emerge from the delicate blossoms of the almond tree and mature within a protective, fuzzy hull. The trees, which belong to the rose family, burst into a spectacle of beauty during full bloom, with fragrant flowers painting the orchards in hues of white and pink.","date":"Feb 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Whispers of spring","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240224_AlmondBloom%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c5d7b20ebf016eeb05f802d48279f3ec","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
