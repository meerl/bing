Covering an area of more than 600 square miles, it is estimated that over 10 million people live there, roughly 15% of the country's population. The capital city is home to a bustling urban infrastructure, featuring a complex network of traffic circles and highways. In 1864, the completion of Charoen Krung Road marked a turn in the city's transit by serving as a pioneering construction project utilizing Western techniques. The introduction of a complex elevated expressway network in 1972 and the Don Mueang Tollway has made it easier to drive in and out of the city. Over the years, the road network has evolved to meet the demands of this sprawling urban expanse.","date":"Mar 5, 2024","bsTitle":"Stuck in a loop?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240305_BangkokCircle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"80fedecb40ee1b377b9ad8f09a17de2b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
