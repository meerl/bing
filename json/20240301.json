Today, let's take a moment to highlight a crucial step that was taken for a more representative democracy—the women's suffrage movement. This image shows a sea of determined faces in a 1915 Manhattan suffrage parade. Pioneers like Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone spearheaded this effort, which culminated in the historic 19th Amendment in 1920, which granted women the right to vote. Over a hundred years later, women now hold 28% of seats in Congress, a dramatic leap forward from the past and a reminder of progress still to be made.","date":"Mar 1, 2024","bsTitle":"And the march goes on","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240301_SuffrageParade%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"5be632f9f33b06b7a76946e2f04100cc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
