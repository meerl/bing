If you head to the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, DC, you're in for a blooming good time! The festival commemorates the 3,000 cherry trees given to the city by the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. Twelve varieties were originally gifted but these days most of the trees are either Yoshino or Kwanzan cherries. Those circling the Tidal Basin, the location of the Jefferson Memorial featured in today's image, are Yoshino trees. The event has evolved to become a four-week celebration that attracts over 1.5 million people every year. The highlights of the festival include a lively parade filled with large, colorful helium balloons, stunning floats, and marching bands from all over the country.","date":"Mar 20, 2024","bsTitle":"Cherry trees spring to life","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240320_CherryBlossomsDC%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"31e4fada4135ec42c950163f0114fb69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
