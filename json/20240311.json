Don't worry, National Napping Day has you covered! This holiday, introduced in 1999 by Boston University professor William Anthony and his wife, Camille, promotes naps and their short-term benefits to mental alertness. Take a cue from today's image; this sleepy koala may inspire you to catch some Z's. These adorable Australian marsupials can sleep up to 20 hours a day, which helps them conserve the little energy they get from their eucalyptus-based diet. Koalas move slowly when awake, spend most of their time tucked into nooks in trees, and have a lower body temperature than other animals of their size. Let's find some time today to sneak off to a peaceful spot to experience the benefits of Napping Day.","date":"Mar 11, 2024","bsTitle":"Sweet dreams are made of leaves","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240311_SleepyKoala%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"00c9a2172e2648cdaf6d78d20641d35b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
