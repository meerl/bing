At nearly 11,250 feet high, this dormant stratovolcano is the tallest mountain in the state, drawing adventurers and nature aficionados alike. With 12 named glaciers and numerous snow fields, Mount Hood offers a wintry playground all year round. It also nurtures ancient forests and provides a haven for wildlife, including cougars and wolves. Over the past 1,800 years, the volcano has erupted three times. While considered dormant, there is still a chance that it could erupt one day.","date":"Feb 8, 2024","bsTitle":"A sleeping giant","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240208_MtHoodOregon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2405ccc0afe74ab83807495d4a00a915","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
