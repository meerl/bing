These days, it is home to bats, about 30,000 of them, as well as rare birds and reptiles. This karst cave was formed by erosion and is now part of a public park. Humans are thought to have sought shelter here as far back as the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years ago, and many Neolithic artefacts from 6000-4000 BCE have been discovered. Several large openings in the cave cast natural light into the chambers, offering better illumination for photographers and nature lovers alike.","date":"Feb 4, 2024","bsTitle":"The skylights are a nice touch","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240204_DevetashkaCave%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"caf9e11c1fe1bd7cd53fb3d49ef21e65","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
