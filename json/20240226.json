It's been 105 years since this Arizona landmark was designated a national park by President Woodrow Wilson in 1919. The origins of this exceptional landscape, carved by the Colorado River, wind, and landslides, date back up to 6 million years. Alongside its steep valleys and colorful rock formations, the canyon holds the stories of Native Americans, European, and American pioneers—the oldest human artifacts found here date back nearly 12,000 years. In addition to tourist adventures such as cruising on the Colorado River, joining the Trail of Time walking tour, or climbing up to the Desert View Watchtower, the park is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a registered International Dark Sky Park for crystal-clear stargazing.","date":"Feb 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Deeply chasm-matic","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240226_GrandCanyonWinter%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"53068a0f77aca1e1c1ad63fa39fd13b0","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
