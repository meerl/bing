Also known as Dragon Falls, the cascade featured in today's image is in a narrow niche at the southern end of the canyon that divides the mountain of Auyán-tepui. Falling from around 1,300 feet, Churún Merú is joined by a neighboring stream in the wet season. Venezuela is home to some of the world's most impressive natural wonders, including the highest waterfall on Earth, Angel Falls, found some 4 miles south of Churún Merú. So, whether you're after angels or dragons, Venezuela has a waterfall for you!","date":"Apr 11, 2024","bsTitle":"Don't just dream it, stream it!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240411_DragonWaterfall%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0f7500a42afc76612e156f6907a8f4bf","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
