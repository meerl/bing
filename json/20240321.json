Established by the UN 11 years ago, the day draws attention to the need to preserve these essential ecosystems, which supply food, water, medicines, and other resources. Covering over 30% of land on Earth, it is thought that woodlands around the world contain more than 60,000 tree species. Featured here is the Bwindi Impenetrable National Forest in Uganda, which is home to 160 species of trees and 100 species of ferns, as well as an extraordinary 50% of the world's mountain gorilla population. The forest has thickets of bamboo growing between the trees, making access on foot difficult, giving the Impenetrable Forest its name.","date":"Mar 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Celebrating forests","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240321_BwindiNationalForest%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"661f97979e595a6ee380f44bd1df778a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
