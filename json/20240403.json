Every year on April 3, National Find a Rainbow Day celebrates this colorful natural phenomenon that delights people all around the world. Rainbows occur when sunlight reflects and disperses through raindrops in the atmosphere. On Find a Rainbow Day, people take part in activities like searching for rainbows after rainfall or creating rainbow-themed art. In today's image, we see a rainbow splashed across the majestic Kakshaal Too Mountains in Kyrgyzstan. The Kakshaal Too range, with its rugged peaks and pristine valleys, is a fitting backdrop for the fleeting beauty of rainbows.","date":"Apr 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Wish hue were here","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240403_KyrgyzstanRainbow%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a7d9e0c47ad95ab9957ebd66a16df0f9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
