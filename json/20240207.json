However, it's the St. James Tidal Pool, pictured on our homepage, that steals the spotlight. This protected bathing area, built between rugged rocks, offers crystal-clear waters for a tranquil swimming experience. The pool is warm compared with the ocean, teems with small marine life, and is perfect for floating around without worrying about strong currents. For those who like to stay dry, the beach is perfect for leisurely strolls, soaking up the sun, and observing the rhythmic ebb and flow of the tides.","date":"Feb 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Swimming with the tide","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240207_StJamesPool%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e16d0cda1a5f5dd16136914f54940046","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
