The conical Arenal Volcano rises to an impressive height of 5,437 feet, standing tall above the surrounding rainforest and Lake Arenal, the largest lake in the country. The sleepy mountain roared to life in a massive 1968 eruption that buried about 6 square miles under rocks, lava, and ash and devastated three villages. The last significant volcanic activity there took place in 2010, and the once lava-lit peak is currently dormant. With over 500 species of birds, Arenal Volcano National Park is a must-visit location for birdwatchers. The park is also home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including red brocket deer, pumas, white-faced monkeys, orchids, heliconias, and ferns. Arenal makes for an imposing and beautiful sight, towering over the tropical trees.","date":"Mar 4, 2024","bsTitle":"A sleeping beauty","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240304_ArenalCostaRica%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"deb85e76c1ea09dfdbf9eba52ac51159","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
