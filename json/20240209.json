This remote beach boasts turquoise waters, but it is the striking rocks that steal the show, standing tall against the might of the Indian Ocean. The rock formations, some of which are 33 feet tall, have given rise to various nicknames, among them Gigi Hiu (shark teeth) and Batu Layar (rock screen) Beach. While this beach has no tourist accommodation, the nearby village of Kiluan presents a haven for visitors. For those ready to trade lounging for exploring, this Sumatran treasure awaits.","date":"Feb 9, 2024","bsTitle":"Rocks and rolling surf","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240209_PegadungRocks%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"9dc779210628aa8bd14bafd523a0fb25","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
