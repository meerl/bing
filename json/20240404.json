These antelopes, known for their distinctive reddish-brown coats and lyre-shaped horns, are native to the wetlands and floodplains of south-central Africa, including the Okavango Delta in Botswana, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Lechwe are social animals, often found in herds of thousands. In the heart of the delta, they are an integral part of the region's rich biodiversity, coexisting with other species like elephants, lions, rhinos, and hippos, wading through the water. Their presence adds to the delta's natural allure, which draws in thousands of safari enthusiasts, and is proof of wildlife's resilience in the face of environmental challenges.","date":"Apr 4, 2024","bsTitle":"Wanderers of the wetlands","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240404_AntelopeBotswana%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fe51bd3429fdcb523b2b57b2a950500d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
