After spending the first months of its life inside the den, this little American black bear may be puzzled by the outside world. The cubs are born between January and February and emerge from their dens in the spring, weighing around 5 pounds. By their first birthday, they can grow to about 80 pounds. However, their weight—which ranges between 100 and 600 pounds for adults—depends on their age, sex, the season, and food available in their area. Black bears are the only bears found in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, which provides the setting for today's image.","date":"Apr 17, 2024","bsTitle":"Have I been sleeping too long?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240417_SpringCub%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"198eb37fa3e9f9b8721c0bd2932676bc","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
