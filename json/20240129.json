Tumbling down in two stages from the mouth of the Schwarzbachfall cave, the 249-foot fall is a sight to behold in every season—whether it's framed by the lush greenery of spring or the icy embrace of winter. This region is known for its natural wonders and is also home to the world’s biggest ice cave, Eisriesenwelt, and the narrow Salzachöfen Gorge, considered to be the birthplace of white-water kayaking. Whether you are into hiking, photography, or just looking to spend some quality time in nature, this is a great Austrian destination.","date":"Jan 29, 2024","bsTitle":"An icy descent","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240129_GollingerFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"1bc60480cc09913109a122d09877421b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
