April 10 is National Siblings Day, a time to celebrate the special bonds shared by brothers and sisters. From friendly rivalries to shared memories, there's nothing quite like the relationship between siblings. Siblings Day was created by Claudia Evart in memory of her siblings Alan and Lisette. Today, it is recognized by 49 states and 14 countries. Celebrations of this day can range from something simple, like phoning your siblings to let them know you're thinking of them, to giving gifts or sharing a meal.","date":"Apr 10, 2024","bsTitle":"Owl be there for you!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240410_OwlSiblings%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"159d395cabe9ffaac84fa71239d3a3b8","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
