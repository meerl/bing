These red-crowned cranes, seen in the reed marshes and frozen lakes of Hokkaido Island, Japan, know how to turn on the charm. The graceful birds call in unison and bow to each other as part of their captivating mating dance. Once a mate is chosen, the pair develop a lifelong bond, a trait that has helped make them a symbol of longevity, fidelity, and good fortune in Japanese culture. These gentle creatures were also the inspiration for the traditional origami crane. According to legend, folding a thousand cranes can grant wishes.","date":"Feb 14, 2024","bsTitle":"The dance of romance","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240214_BowingCrane%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"48f8b8b1121f5f17c8751bd1a1a0a720","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
