Today we are highlighting the works of Charles McGee, a painter, sculptor, and educator from Detroit, whose works are found all over the Motor City. The 20-foot-tall sculpture seen here, 'United We Stand,' represents themes of togetherness, unity, and balance and sits outside the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. McGee's pieces, which he produced up until his death in 2021, often feature abstract collections of lines, patterns, and allusions to nature, either in striking black and white or vibrant colors. He is one of many Black artists who have left an indelible mark on the great canvas of American art, along with others such as Joshua Johnson, Edmonia Lewis, Jacob Lawrence, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kara Walker, and Kehinde Wiley.","date":"Feb 25, 2024","bsTitle":"Say it loud","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240225_WrightSculpture%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":false,"hsh":"fb33bf87e7cbd6e9d0a29a5a87924d05","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
