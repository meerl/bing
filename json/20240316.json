These bamboo-munching creatures, with their distinctive black and white coats and playful demeanor, have captivated hearts for years. So much so that in 1961, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) adopted the animal as its iconic logo. National Panda Day, observed on March 16, helps to raise awareness about panda conservation and their fight for survival amid the destruction of their natural habitat. To curb the threat, the Chinese government built more than 50 reserves and by 2016, pandas were reclassified from an endangered to a vulnerable species. However, with fewer than 2,000 giant pandas remaining in the wild, the fight to protect them is far from over.","date":"Mar 16, 2024","bsTitle":"Somewhat bamboo-zled","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240316_BambooPanda%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fda6d7075bdab0ce15b93361f91a5152","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
