A popular tourist attraction, they first popped up on Brighton's coastline in 1860, providing somewhere for swimmers to change into their bathing suits. They have been moved, repaired, and added to since then, and while they each have their own distinctive coat of paint, the bathing boxes are built in the same traditional style. Despite facing the threat of removal over the years, these vibrant coast guards remain, adding a splash of color to the beach, and providing their owners with somewhere to sit and enjoy the view.","date":"Feb 22, 2024","bsTitle":"A bonanza of beach huts","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240222_BrightonBoxes%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4b37b2cd07bd24ac3f4916b1868770ac","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
