This aerial photograph shows a flamboyance of lesser flamingos against the backdrop of Lake Magadi in Kenya. The lesser flamingo is one of six species of flamingo, a bird known for its vibrant pink plumage and distinctive feeding behavior. They use their specialized beaks to filter algae near the water's surface and are often found in African soda lakes like Lake Magadi, which are brimming with cyanobacteria and algae for them to eat. The spectacle of thousands of these avian wonders congregating at the lake reveals the importance of these unique ecosystems.","date":"Mar 13, 2024","bsTitle":"Bird's-eye view","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240313_MagadiFlamingos%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c185bbd0efbd05eed35f79d0cc0a468b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
