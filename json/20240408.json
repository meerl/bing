Today, you can witness a rare celestial event—a total solar eclipse! As the moon perfectly aligns between the Earth and the sun, daylight will shift eerily to twilight. The total solar eclipse will be visible across North America, from Mazatlán, Mexico, to eastern Canada's Newfoundland Island, for up to four and a half minutes between 10:57 AM PST and 4:47 PM ADT. It will be the first total solar eclipse visible in the continental United States since August 21, 2017, although one occurs somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months. Astronomers study the sun's corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere, its magnetic fields, and the behavior of Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse. Keep an eye on the time today and find a good spot to put on eclipse-safe solar glasses and see the golden ring emerge.","date":"Apr 8, 2024","bsTitle":"Enter the eclipse","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240408_SolarEclipseOregon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"37410a0f1df48aee5742e420e255072a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
