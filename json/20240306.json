Fed by Tanner Creek, a tributary of the Columbia River, these waterfalls were named after a Native American village by members of the Mazama Mountaineering Club. At the end of a trail, visitors can see the spectacular two-tiered cascade that crashes down 350 feet into a pool below, which is the perfect place to take a dip and cool off. While you're swimming, keep an eye out for the water ouzel—also known as the American dipper—a species of bird that lives here. They can be spotted flying along the stream and occasionally diving into the water.","date":"Mar 6, 2024","bsTitle":"Get your splash on","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240306_WahclellaFalls%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ee24fa8e4fa3cb0f27be92ed8fc28e69","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
