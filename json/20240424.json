Native to eastern North America, the spring-blooming species is one of the most common woodland wildflowers. Unlike some impulsive blossoms that burst into color at the slightest hint of warmth, this plant is a slow bloomer. From gracing US postage stamps to being the state wildflower of Ohio and an official symbol of Canada's Ontario, the white trillium is ingrained in our culture. Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the plant has earned its stripes in the world of herbal medicine. So, next time you find yourself wandering through the woodland realm, keep an eye out for this floral gem!","date":"Apr 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Hey, how's it growing today?","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240424_TrilliumOntario%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"2d2c49df10a1c386f159beb5bf9d674f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
